               <p style="font-size:18px;color:#595954">Bhashyam has completed over two and a half decades in the realm of education, and along the way the institution has produced numerous achievers and inspirers who continue to make their mark across the globe today.</br></br>
                     What started as an initiative to impart education to enable success, has today taken shape and has spread into a pedagogic institution that is providing children a head-start to become our alumni who shall inspire value and vision in the future. 
                     As we are proud of our past generation of students, we look forward to this generation of achievers as well, who we believe will be the next set of Bhashyamites dotting the world achievers' map.</p>

                <p style="font-size:18px;color:#595954">"I have learnt more as a teacher than as a student. I have learnt that it is easy to dream but difficult to turn it into a reality. The path of realisation of the dream is full of pitfalls and hurdles. Sometimes it can be very disappointing too. But, if I have been able to overcome all these and reach this stage of success it is because I had the unstinted support of the patient and  understanding parents, students and well-wishers." ...Bhashyam Rama Krishna</p>
